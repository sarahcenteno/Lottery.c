# lotteryProgram
This project was completed for my Computer Science I course. I have developed a program that implements dynamic memory allocation to find the winners of the lottery. To do so, the program will read an input text file of all the players participating in the lottery and their lottery numbers. Then, through dynamic memory allocation, it will check to see which players have matching lottery numbers and determine their winnings. It will print out those results into an output text file. 

# Getting Started
To implement this program, you can either create your own input text file of the players and their lottery numbers or you can use the one provided. To create your own input text file it must have the following format:
10
Swift Taylor
3 18 25 34 35 48
Gomez Selena
4 6 25 35 38 47
Grande Ariana
3 13 25 34 38 45
Smith Sam
3 18 25 35 37 52
Kaneki Ken
1 12 24 38 43 53
Ackerman Mikasa
3 13 25 28 43 53
Kirishima Touka
7 13 25 38 43 53
Midoriya Izuku
11 14 25 38 43 47
Uraraka Ochaco
17 19 25 38 43 53 
Mineta Minoru
3 13 25 38 43 53

The first number listed on top will be the total number of players participating in the lottery. It can be as many players as you like. For the next line, you type in the last name and first name of the player. The line after, you type in the six lottery numbers you want to assign for that player. Then, continue on until you finished inputting all the players and their lottery numbers. 
NOTE: the input text file must be .in format
